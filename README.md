##Bidirectional Cross-Attention of Syntactic and Semantic Graphs for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis in Low-Resource Languages##

BanglaBCA leverages bidirectional cross-attention between syntactic and semantic graphs to enhance aspect-level sentiment analysis for Bengali, a low-resource language. It integrates transformer embeddings with graph convolutional networks derived from rule-based syntactic parsing and semantic similarity. Experimental results show significant performance improvements on a Bengali ABSA dataset, offering a robust solution for underrepresented languages.
